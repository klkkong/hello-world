## About "create a branch"
If someone else made changes to the `master` branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

When a change is ready, they merge their branch into `master`.

## About "make and commit changes"

On GitHub, saved changes are called *commits*.

## About "open a pull request"

Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. Pull requests show *diffs*, or differences, of the content from both branched. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.

As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.

You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself. It's a great way to learn the GitHub flow before working on larger projects.
